{"name":"Qgis C++ Plugin Cookbook","tagline":"A cookbook for building C++ Qgis and Qt plugins","body":"### Another Cookbook\r\nYep. QGIS uses the [Qt Project](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtdoc/index.html) \r\nas the main GUI building block. Both projects have C++ intefaces. Given that, \r\nit is surprising the QGIS community does not have a good tutorial on building plugins\r\nin the native interface ( it's actually not that surpising. See the next section ):\r\n\r\n- Some proof of the need [here](http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/17/Writing_C++_Plugins_%5BNew%5D) \r\nand [here](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/34147/where-can-i-find-documentation-on-qgis-c-plugin-development).\r\n\r\n- Existing code examples ( that are not core C++ plugins themselves ) are old \r\nand don't cover the new QGIS 2.0 API ( [here](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Code-Examples) )\r\n\r\n### Should I Build QGIS Plugins in Python or C++?\r\nProbably Python. The QGIS community has put a lot of effort into documenting how to build Python\r\nplugins. One benefit of using Python is that you don't have to deal with all the different operating\r\nsystems, build enviroments and plugin distribution.\r\n\r\nThat said, if you are a C++ programmer and learning Python seems boring, then this \r\ntutorial will show you how to become familiar with the API basics. You can deal\r\nwith the distribution issues on your own.\r\n\r\n### How to Use the Cookbook\r\nGo over to this repo's [example plugins](https://github.com/thebigspoon/qgis_cpp_plugin_cookbook/tree/gh-pages/plugin_code_examples) \r\ndirectory and start at `01`. You get the picture.\r\n\r\n### How to Contribute to the Cookbook\r\n\r\n1. clone the repo\r\n\r\n2. install node\r\n\r\n3. get coffee\r\n\r\n4. make money\r\n\r\n5. more to come\r\n\r\n6. udpate the next section\r\n\r\n### Current Plugin Tutorials\r\n\r\n1. Hello World ( `qmake` versus `cmake` workflows )\r\n\r\n2. Map Tool Driller ( part 1 )\r\n\r\n3. Map Tool Driller ( part 2 )\r\n\r\n4. Map Tool Driller ( part 3 )\r\n\r\n5. Map Tool Driller ( part 4 )\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nGreg Corradini ( @thebigspoon ) and James Dominguez ( @keppy )\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nDrop it like it's hot on the [issue page over here](https://github.com/thebigspoon/qgis_cpp_plugin_cookbook/issues)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
