Because...:

    1. The QGIS community doesn't have a good howto on building C++ plugins. Proof ( [here](http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/17/Writing_C++_Plugins_%5BNew%5D) and [here](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/34147/where-can-i-find-documentation-on-qgis-c-plugin-development) )

    2. Current code examples are old and don't cover the new QGIS 2.0 API ( [here](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Code-Examples) )

    3. C++ is fun

    4. [@keppy](https://github.com/keppy) is the kind of dude who puts bugs in your butt to do certain projects
