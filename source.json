### Another Cookbook
Yep. QGIS uses the [Qt Project](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtdoc/index.html) 
as the main GUI building block. Both projects have C++ intefaces. Given that, 
it is surprising the QGIS community does not have a good tutorial on building plugins
in the native interface ( it's actually not that surpising. See the next section ):

- Some proof of the need [here](http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/17/Writing_C++_Plugins_%5BNew%5D) 
and [here](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/34147/where-can-i-find-documentation-on-qgis-c-plugin-development).

- Existing code examples ( that are not core C++ plugins themselves ) are old 
and don't cover the new QGIS 2.0 API ( [here](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Code-Examples) )

### Should I Build QGIS Plugins in Python or C++?
Probably Python. The QGIS community has put a lot of effort into documenting how to build Python
plugins. One benefit of using Python is that you don't have to deal with all the different operating
systems, build enviroments and plugin distribution.

That said, if you are a C++ programmer and learning Python seems boring, then this 
tutorial will show you how to become familiar with the API basics. You can deal
with the distribution issues on your own.

### How to Use the Cookbook
Go over to this repo's [example plugins](https://github.com/thebigspoon/qgis_cpp_plugin_cookbook/tree/gh-pages/plugin_code_examples) 
directory and go into `01_hello_world`.
